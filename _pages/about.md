# The gory details :)

## My background

My journey kicked off with a Diploma in Physics. I hold a Ph.D. (Doctorate) in Mechanical Engineering from Germany, which is equivalent to a U.S. doctorate. My first encounter with the world of software engineering happened during my diploma thesis (signal analysis), and I was hooked instantly! Hacking C++ code using the Design Patterns on a Linux machine (1995, self compiled kernel) opened up a whole new world of possibilities.

Over the years I worked in many diverse areas such as supply chain, retail, finance and research. I worked on business intelligence projects using machine learning. I built process chains for enterprise controlling. I designed and developed optimisation software for logistics. 

I’ve had the chance to tackle some truly fascinating challenges, blending tech with practical solutions. Software’s been my path ever since, and I haven’t looked back!

## My approach to custom software

One says that only 50% of all requirements are really needed in the final product -  so why don't we start with that?

I follow the ***Working backwards*** process by Amazon which is used for every customer-facing product or service developed across the company.  The process starts with the creation of three key elements:

1. **A Press Release**: The press release is a one-page document that describes the new product or service using customer-centric language. 

2. **Frequently Asked Questions**: What will be the most asked questions about the product. What are the most important features to get to know?
    
3. **Visuals**: A set of screens that represent the customer experience. 

This approach is iterative and collaborative. However, the key point here is: _**Think the product from the end!**_

I am keen advocate of **[Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)**. It saves money, nerves and makes the ride much less bumpier. Having a bunch auf automated tests goes hand in hand with Continuous Deployment, i.e run all the tests before anything goes online.

Last but not least I value collaboration and interaction as well as I embrace change. I am well aware that is immensely difficult to find the best solution on your first attempt. Good solutions need hard work and software that is adaptable to change.

For seamless collaboration, I use **[Jira](https://jira.atlassian.com)** and **[Confluence](https://confluence.atlassian.com)** as our project office, keeping everything organised, transparent, and easily accessible. This approach keeps us aligned and ensures a smooth, predictable path to delivery.




<!--In the realm of mobile development, I thrive on turning ideas into functional and aesthetically pleasing applications. From concept to deployment, I am dedicated to delivering mobile solutions that seamlessly integrate with users' lives.
