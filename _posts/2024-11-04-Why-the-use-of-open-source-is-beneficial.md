As a software engineer, I am always faced with the decision of developing functionality myself or integrating it via an external module. My credo here is clear:

## Thinking out of the box

A lot has happened in the IT world since the beginning of OOS. Whereas 20 years ago open source software was still the playground of unworldly nerds, it has long since become **the** backbone for many software applications. And we're not talking about typical Internet servers. Open source is used everywhere in the commercial environment.

It is now often the case that commercial software is just a wrapper for the software behind it. Why? The development speed of software driven by many minds is simply many times greater than that of a single company. For example, it is now assumed that in the field of artificial intelligence, it is not companies [such as Meta, OpenAI etc. that provide the spearhead of the models, but the open source community](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/)

There are a number of tangible reasons to use open source software.

1. Cost savings: There are no license costs. Companies can thus save money and use their budgets elsewhere. A lot of time is often spent developing workarounds to cope with the requirements of proprietary software. This time is lost for the development of the actual functionality.
    
2. Transparency: Insight into the source code helps immensely when analyzing and solving problems.When using proprietary software, customers are dependent on manufacturer support and any bug fixes (which are only available in the long term).
    
3. Customizability: If something is missing, the functionality can be implemented by in-house developers.You don't have to hope that a company will take on a request at some point. Instead, there is a “you can do it” mentality. I have often experienced that it takes a lot of time to “rebuild” trivial things just because they were not available in the manufacturer's software. That always leads to a lot of discussions.
    
4. Security: Community maintenance of the code leads to faster identification and rectification of problems. This increases security.
    
5. Flexibility: Open source software can be easily integrated with other tools. The developers come from many different areas and always have the topic of integration on their radar.
    
6. Innovation: Open source software uses short development cycles per se. Thanks to the input of many developers scattered around the world, innovation can be integrated quickly.
    
7. Support: A large community of users and contributors often provide free resources, documentation and support. If you get involved here you will also find help!
    
8. **Avoidance of vendor lock-in**: Open standards and the lack of restrictive licenses reduce dependence on a single provider and give you more autonomy.
    

Vendor lock-in is a particularly critical point. The point here is not that once you have decided in favor of a manufacturer's software, you have to live with that software forever and ever. Vendor lock-in also manifests itself in other aspects:

- The maintenance and customization of proprietary software requires expert knowledge that can only be obtained from the manufacturer. That costs!
    
- Costs are often incurred solely through updates forced by the manufacturer (because the old version is no longer maintained) - without any gain in functionality.
    
- Manufacturer consultants naturally see the software through the eyes of their employer. This means that solutions that are more efficient in many respects, but require _out of the box_ thinking, are discarded because they do not fit into the manufacturer's concept. The wheel is often reinvented here. The use of open source software simplifies many things here - simply because you can build on existing solutions.
    

A word about costs: It is assumed that [60% of the costs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cost-software-development-vs-maintenance-braintly-b9dhf/) are attributable to maintenance. This means that every piece of software that was **not** developed (by me) and is therefore maintained elsewhere has a positive effect on the overall costs.
