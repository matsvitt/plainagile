## Business Intelligence Solution for Data-Driven Decision Control

In this project, I designed a comprehensive business intelligence (BI) process chain that serves as the single source of truth for controlling decisions within the company. Utilizing a tech stack based on  SAS Base, SAS Data Integration Studio, Python and PostgreSQL — I built a streamlined data pipeline that ensures consistent, high-quality data flow from collection to analysis.

Using SAS Visual Analytics, I delivered interactive reports and dashboards tailored for decision-makers, empowering them with near real-time insights. I also developed data gateways using Python, Flask and SASPy to facilitate seamless data exchange across platforms, including SAP.

The solution's backbone is an automated booking process for SAP, developed with SAS, Python, and SAP integrations, enabling accurate financial postings and operational efficiency. A monitoring system was also implemented to provide full oversight of the process chain, securing reliability at each stage.

This robust BI foundation has become essential to the company’s data-driven strategy, providing precise, actionable insights.
