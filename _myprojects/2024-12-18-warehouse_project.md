## Multi-User Warehouse Planning Software: Streamlining Storage Management and Reducing Costs

In this project, I developed a web-based tool for warehouse planning, enabling companies to model and enhance storage operations with precision. Built with Java, Vaadin, Hazelcast and MongoDB, this solution supports a wide variety of warehouse types and layouts. A defining feature of this tool is its ability to generate planning models directly from a complex network of Microsoft Excel sheets, which were automatically analyzed and transformed into a robust calculation model in Java.

To simplify customization, I developed interfaces for easy parameter adjustments in Excel, enabling rapid configuration by users without technical expertise. The system also features a role based user management system to manage user permissions across customer projects, ensuring secure, compliant access.

Thanks to Hazelcast, the solution is multi-user capable, allowing multiple users to work on the same model simultaneously, facilitating collaboration and reducing operational costs. Delivered as a Docker service, this flexible, scalable tool empowers teams with a reliable, cost-effective solution for optimized warehouse planning.
