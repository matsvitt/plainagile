## Predictive Maintenance Solution for Structural Health Monitoring Using Advanced Fiber Optic Sensing

In this project, I developed a specialized software solution for predictive maintenance in the field of structural health monitoring. Designed to assess the stability of large structures, this tool utilizes Rayleigh scattering in fiber optics to achieve highly accurate stress measurements. Extensive research was conducted to build this solution, involving a deep analysis of numerous scientific papers to guide and validate the approach.

The projectâ€™s technical foundation includes custom algorithms built with Python, leveraging libraries such as Numpy, scikit-learn and Dask for efficient data processing. The solution runs within a Docker environment, ensuring smooth deployment and scalability. Machine learning techniques, implemented with scikit-learn, were used to identify and remove outliers from raw signal data, significantly improving the quality and reliability of the analysis.

This advanced monitoring software empowers structural health specialists to monitor stress levels accurately, ensuring the safety and longevity of critical infrastructure.
